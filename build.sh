#
#   GameCube disc    the European Animal Crossing (GAFP01), .iso/.gcm/.ciso:
#                    the English dialogue, names and letters
#   Japanese ROM     Animal Forest (NUS-NAFJ): the game's code is recompiled
#                    from it
#   fan translation  optional: "Animal Forest (U) [!]", a patch of the Japanese
#                    ROM, which the game then plays (English logo, menus and
#                    screens). Without it the game plays the Japanese ROM: the
#                    dialogue, names and letters are still English, but the
#                    title screen, menus and signs are Japanese.
#
# (scripts/find_inputs.py and scripts/prepare_rom.py tell them apart.) The build is
# specific to the ROM the game plays: switching between the two recompiles the game.
#
# The repo holds no game data (bar the EBOOT's icon and background, screenshots
# of the port's title screen): everything comes from these files. The result
# is dist/AFPSP/, the folder to copy to ms0:/PSP/GAME/ (or PPSSPP's PSP/GAME/).
#
# Tools needed (BUILDING.md has the details): the PSPDEV toolchain with
# psp-media-engine-custom-core, MIPS binutils and the other prerequisites of
# the zeldaret/af decomp, GNU make 4, git, CMake, Ninja, a C++20 compiler,
# Python 3. Everything downloaded or generated goes under work/ and build/;
# a second run only redoes what changed.
#
# Environment: PSPDEV (default ~/pspdev), JOBS (default: all cores),
# KCALL_PRX (path to psp-media-engine-custom-core's kcall.prx, copied into dist).
