/*
 * gfx_draw.c -- GE render state and triangles.
 *
 * A draw state (combiner, render mode, textures) becomes GE state when the
 * first triangle is drawn with it (prepare_3d_state): the combiner's fit
 * (gfx_combiner.c) picks the texture function and the texture to bind
 * (gfx_bind.c), the render mode the depth test, blending, alpha test and fog.
 * Triangles are collected in batches until the state changes, then drawn with
 * one sceGuDrawArray; their vertices are snapped to the PSP's pixel grid
 * first, so that meshes that meet leave no gaps.
 *
 * The GE projects the vertices itself (the projection matrix is uploaded by
 * gfx_frame.c) but drops any triangle that leaves its coordinate range or,
 * with depth clipping off, its depth range. So triangles are clipped here
 * against a guard band and the eye plane, and pieces in front of the near
 * plane or beyond the far plane -- which the N64's NoN microcode clamps per
 * pixel -- are drawn separately with their depth pinned to that plane.

/*
 * The RSP hands the RDP screen positions in quarter pixels, and the RDP draws
 * every pixel a triangle covers any part of (it samples four sub-scanlines per
 * row). So neighbouring meshes whose edges nearly meet -- the village's ground
 * blocks, 0.08 pixel apart where they join -- never leave an empty pixel
 * between them on the N64. The GE samples one point per pixel, its centre, and
 * a sliver of a pixel between two edges can hold a PSP pixel centre: a line of
 * background across the screen, coming and going as the camera moves.
 *
 * So vertices are snapped to a grid, and vertices that nearly coincide are
 * welded: rounded on their own, two vertices 0.08 pixel apart land on
 * different grid points some of the time, and the snap then *widens* the
 * sliver to a grid step (a line of blue across the grass on the PSP-1000).
 * Every vertex sent in a task is remembered with its grid point, and one
 * within WELD_RADIUS of an earlier one takes that one's grid point instead of
 * its own, if it is at the same depth: two meshes meeting at a point agree on
 * its depth, something in front of them does not. The radius has to cover the
 * beach, where blocks meet 0.15-0.18 N64 pixel apart (a dotted line down the
 * grass and sand), and a diagonal join in the village whose sides are 0.23 N64
 * pixel (0.35 PSP pixel) apart, 0.51 PSP pixel at one corner.
 *
 * The grid is the PSP's, not the N64's: half a PSP pixel apart, at 5/16 and
 * 13/16 of each pixel (SNAP_PHASE). Welded vertices are not equal on the
 * hardware. The GE rounds screen positions to 1/16 pixel, and its own
 * transform put the two sides of an acre join 0.03-0.09 pixel apart although
 * they were sent to the same point (the village's coordinates are in the
 * thousands; PPSSPP, which rasterises on the host's GPU, shows none of this).
 * So a shared edge can come out one 1/16 step apart, and when the GE's sample
 * point -- between 9/16 and 10/16 down the pixel, as measured by shifting the
 * picture a sixteenth at a time -- is in that step, the row belongs to
 * neither side: on the N64's quarter-pixel grid, which falls anywhere on the
 * PSP's, the join at y = 269.595 went to 269.5625 above and 269.625 below
 * and left row 269 blue. The grid points here are a quarter pixel from the
 * sample points on both sides.
 *
 * The GE projects the eye-space position itself (GU_TRANSFORM_3D), so the snap
 * is applied as a nudge in eye space: the 2x2 Jacobian of the screen position
 * with respect to eye x and y is inverted for each vertex. The nudge is at most
 * a quarter of a pixel, so the linearisation is exact to well under that. It
 * has to be general: in the village AF folds the camera into the projection,
 * so eye y feeds clip w too (P[1][3] != 0), and a nudge that assumed a plain
 * perspective left the village unsnapped -- a line of blue across the ground.
