/*
 * gfx_target.c -- render targets: the game's own small pictures, drawn on the GE.
 *
 * AF draws a few things into small colour images of its own and then uses
 * them as textures: the player's portrait in the pocket screen (128x128, over
 * a copy of the screen behind it) and the item pictures beside it (32x32).
 *
 * Such images, up to TARGET_MAX square, are drawn on the GE at N64 resolution in
 * spare VRAM after the third colour buffer, with their own depth buffer. RDRAM
 * stays the reference: a target is loaded from it when drawing starts, and
 * what the GE drew is copied back in the N64's format, so that every later
 * use -- through the texture cache, in any format -- sees what the RDP would
 * have drawn. The GE's destination alpha is its stencil buffer, so the
 * stencil stands in for the 5551 alpha (coverage) bit: 1 wherever something
 * was drawn.
 *
 * A copy-back has to wait for the GE to finish everything queued, and the
 * pocket screen leaves its targets seven times a frame, which made it the one
 * screen far from 30 fps. On the N64 none of this costs anything: the RDP
 * draws into RDRAM and the next texture load reads the same memory. So the
 * copy is avoided wherever the same can be said here:
 *
 * - It is put off until something reads the picture from RDRAM
 *   (gfx_target_need: a texture built from it, another target laid over it,
 *   the end of the task). While the display list is merely away drawing on
 *   the screen or clearing a depth buffer, the picture stays in VRAM and the
 *   target is taken up again as it is.
 * - A texture that is the picture itself, whole, is not built at all: the GE
 *   samples it where it drew it (gfx_target_texture), as the RDP would.
 * - A fill of the whole target with one colour is repeated in RDRAM directly
 *   (gfx_target_filled). Where the fill keeps the coverage bits, that takes
 *   knowing them: RDRAM's are right if nothing was drawn since the last
 *   copy, and they are all set once rectangles have covered the target from
 *   the top down (gfx_target_covered), as the portrait's background does.
 * - Loading goes the same way: the picture in RDRAM is not brought into VRAM
 *   before something is drawn that shows through to it (gfx_target_ready).
 *
 * With these the pocket screen moves no pixels between RDRAM and VRAM at all:
 * each of its pictures starts with a clear or with rectangles that cover it,
 * is drawn, sampled from VRAM, and painted over before the task ends.
